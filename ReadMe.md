# Navigation

To navigate smoothly through the Enhancements folder you can click on any of the enhancements you will see the porfolio
links. You will be able to navivate through each of the enhancements as well as the self-assessment and code review without
needing to return to the file selection. When you click on the enhacnement number in the portfolio links you will notice 
that there is a link to the repository where the code is stored for each of these enhancements. When you click on these repositories 
you will have to click the back button on your web browser to come back or click on the name to the left of the repository (xyph9r) 
to return to all of the repositories and find xyph9r.github.io to return to the projects original repository.
You may also use the CodeReview or the index(self-assessment) file to start your navigation throughout the project.
