## Enhancement One: Software Engineering & Design

The artifact that I chose for the Software Engineering/Design enhancement was a Sudoku Solver in the C++ programming language
and transferring it to the language C. The purpose of this code is to demonstrate my abilities by using C++ as my beginning language 
and being able to change my code into another language of my choice. 


I chose to include this artifact in my portfolio because it demonstrates my ability to transfer my code C++. Another reason I chose this artifact is because
I knew I could use a Sudoku Solver to work with all three of the enhacnements to showcase my skills of working with a single base artifact and modifying it
from there. This turned out to be beneficial because I could use what I learned previously with languages and apply it for the purposes of this class. My enhancements to this code 
involve switching the code from C++ to C and including comments in all the places to help those understand what was happening. Overall, I believe the enhancement of this artifact 
shows my ability of Software engineering and design by being able to trasnfer from one language to another.

While I had and idea of how to enhance this artifact I knew I needed to remember how to code in this different langauges so I reviewed some of my previous work from other classes.
As a result, I had to spend quite a bit of time refamiliarizing myself with the languages and go through and make sure the comments were written well as well as the code being 
designed structurally well. I had originially planned to code in the Java programming language however things occured so I was unable to keep it that way so I had to remodify for
the final project.In addition to being able to swap from one coding language to another I actually swapped my starter code into two but languages however the Java one encountered
issues.
