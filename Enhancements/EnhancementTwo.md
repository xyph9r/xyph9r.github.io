## Enhancement Two: Data Structures & Algorithms

The artifact that I chose for the Algorithms and Data Structure enhancement was a Sudoku Solver in the Java programming language with a different algorithm than the 
previous enhancement. The backtracking algorithm that I will be implementing allows for us to assign numbers one by one to empty cells. But before we assign these numbers we check to see
if it is safe to assign them. Check to make sure the same number is not present in the current row or column or the current
3x3 subgrid. Once we check for safety we can assign the number and recursively check if the assignment leads to a solution. 
If the assignement does not lead to a solution we try the next number for the empty cell. If no numbers (1 to 9) lead to a 
solution then return false and print no solution exists.

I chose to include this artifact in my portfolio because it allowed for me to demonstrate a different type of algorithm in order to achieve the same goal as the first enhancment
but with a more complex setting. I think that using a Sudoku Solver for this enhancment was super benefical because there is an algorithm when it comes to solving a sudoku puzzle 
and being able to show a more advanced algorithm shows the skills and that I was able to satisfy this category. 

Java is one of my favorite programming languages which is why in the first enhancement I was going to use the Java language but ended up having to use C. I had a good idea of what
needed to be done in order to change the algorithm so that part went smoothly and since I was using one of my more liked languages I did not have to 
brush up on the way to code in this language nearly as much as the first enhancement. I had a lot of fun with this enhacnement and was able to deliver the 
output that I was expecting.
