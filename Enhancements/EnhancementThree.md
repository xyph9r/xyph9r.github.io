## Enhancement Three: Databases

The artifact that I chose for the Database enhancement was a Sudoku Solver in Javascript/HTML. The JavaScript is the code that actually implements how the Sudoku Solver will solve
the puzzle. The HTML sets up and designs a template for the Sudoku Solver displaying the inital board on the left hand side with the empty cells and the answer board on the right
side onve ytou click the button. The JavaScript has a few boards within it for tests and it has an impossible to solve board. The way the algorithm works in this one is that it is 
more closely aligned to the inital Sudoku Solver displayed within my code review. I had initially planned on something else for this enhacnement but I could not figure out how to 
do the mongoDB and creating a Sudoku Solver using that so I went this route instead.

I chose to include this artifact in my portfolio because it allowed for me to demonstrate my ability to use JavaScript and HTML which is used to communicate with databases in the server.
I also chose this artifact because I knew it would be a more challenging one since I do not personally like writing in HTML and I wanted to prove that I could do succsessful fulfill this 
enhacement using HTML which I have not enjoyed since I started learning about it in middle school. 

This enhancement took me the most time out of all the other ones due to me not fully understanding exactly what it was I needed to do in this enhancement. I had started out trying to work
with mongoDB to find a way to create a sudoku solver or do anything with the sudoku solver but I ended up falling short. I had to brainstorm what I could do next then I saw in the project 
that we could use JavaScript/HTML so I decided to go down this route. Depsite the frustrations that I encountered throughout this enhancement I believe that it turned out really well and
I am glad I was able to push through the roadblocks and come out with an outcome.
