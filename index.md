# CS-499 ePortfolio


## Introduction

I’ve been in the SNHU Computer Science program for almost two years now. I started school at Germanna Community College where I got my associates degree then went for my bachelor's degree here at SNHU. 

## Educational Reflection

I’ve learned a lot of things throughout my few years here at SNHU. First, I think attention to detail is a crucial skill to have in this field. There have been many times that my code has failed to compile, all because of a simple mistake or a typo in the code. Attention to detail relates goes hand in hand with code review. By using code reviews, we can have our peers review our code and look for mistakes that we may have missed. Like with proofreading a paper, having a fresh set of eyes on something can help locate easily overlooked mistakes. Another concept that I’ve learned that is important and it deals with testing and its methodology. Testing is crucial to ensuring a program works, and becomes more complicated as a project grows. Adopting the mindset of a tester is important when working on your projects. We have to figure out how to break something that works to find the flaws in our project. Finally, learning about the Software Development Lifecycle was eye-opening. I never really thought about working on a large-scale project with a team before, but there are a lot of logistics that go into planning a large project and coordinating with coworkers. Additionally, being able to understand the needs of the client and translating those needs into direction for employees is important as well.


## Portfolio Summary


All of the courses throughout the Computer Science program have helped me acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to position my self for a job in this industry. CS-250 taught me much about the Software Development Lifecyle and how communication with the client is important. CS-260 was a great lesson on data structures and algorithms. CS-310 showed me the basics of collaboration and explained how working together is necessary for large projects. CS-330 was an information look into the complexity of computer graphics. CS-340 helped me learn about create and use databases and showed how useful they can be.

While my learning was not restricted to just these classes that I mentioned, I do feel that these were some of the more important classes in the program. From these classes I learned things I was not aware of initially. Because of that I wanted to incorporate the things I learned into my Portfolio. My first enhancement is using the programming language C++ which is a good language to know in order to develop operating systems or browsers. I chose to do this do demonstrate my skills working different programming languages using a single idea(Sudoku Solver). My second enhancement builds off of the first enhancement but I wrote it in a different language and used a different algorithm. I chose to rewrite it in a different language to display further display my learnings throughout my degree as well as changing the algorithm so it is more complex and satisfied this part of the project of data structures and algorithms. Finally, my third enhancement is using Javascript and HTML which I have no worked with much inside of the program at this school soI thought it would bea good way to represent my last set of skills and satsifying the databases enhancement.

Overall, these artifacts represent one project but they are different in how they are written and work. I think that together they allow me to demonstrate what I've learned throughout the program. I believe the enhancements made to these three projects represent my learning and display my competency in this program.

## Preparing For The Future

I have not had a job but I am very eager to prove to the industry that I have what it takes by using these skills that I have learned throughout this program to be a greater work and co-woker to those around me. Right now, my career plans are up in the air but, I am constantly looking at job opportunities that interest me. I just do not have anything concrete set for when I finish college. The most likely outcome is that I'll find a job in this field of some sort even if it is not the initial job I would like. I will work my way up and eventually be able to do whatever it is I feel like I would enjoy doing such as a game developer.
